# Introduction

This service provides a means to persist and retrieve notifications. The upstream client is the `ap-notificaion-pull` service.  

## Endpoints

### POST `/queue`

Payload must be text based, e.g. XML
When each message is put onto the queue database, a unique id will be generated. This id is used later for deleting the message once forwarded.
Either the X-Client-ID or subscription-fields-id header must be included in the request. If the subscription-fields-id is supplied, 
the client-id will be retrieved from the api-subscription-fields service.

```
curl -v -X POST \
  http://localhost:9000/queue \
  -H 'accept: application/xml' \
  -H 'content-type: application/xml' \
  -H 'x-client-id: 200b01f9-ec3b-4ede-b263-61b626dde232' \
  -d '<xml>foo</xml>'
``` 

#### Response
